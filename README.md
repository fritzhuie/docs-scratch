#### Add the code

Once ads is enabled, any script can be used to show ads with two lines of code:

1.  In your script, include the Unity Ads namespace:

 	`using UnityEngine.Advertisements;`

2. Then, show an ad:  
	`Advertisement.Show()`

#### Show Rewarded ads

> Rewarding players can add to user engagement, resulting in higher revenue!
> Typically, rewarded ad implementation involve one or more of the following: 
> - In-game currency or consumables
> - Extra lives at the start of the game
> - Point boosts for the next round

You can reward players for completing a video ad using the **HandleShowResult** callback method in the example below. Be sure to check that the **result** is equal to **ShowResult.Finished** to verify that the ad was not skipped.

1. In your script, add a callback method
2. Pass the method as a perameter when when calling show
3. Call show() with the "RewardedVideo" placement to make the video unskippable:

> Note: See our [Placements](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/placements) page to learn more about placements

```
void ShowRewardedVideo ()
{
	var options = new ShowOptions();
	options.resultCallback = HandleShowResult;
	
	Advertisement.Show("rewardedVideo", options);
}

void HandleShowResult (ShowResult result)
{
	if(result == ShowResult.Finished) {
		Debug.Log("Video completed - Offer a reward to the player");
		
	}else if(result == ShowResult.Skipped) {
		Debug.LogWarning("Video was skipped - Do NOT reward the player");
		
	}else if(result == ShowResult.Failed) {
		Debug.LogError("Video failed to show");
	}
}
```

#### Example Ads Button code

Use this code to create a rewarded ads button that becomes interactable when ads are available, then shows an ad when pressed.

  1. Select **Game Object > UI > Button** to add a Button in your scene.
  2. Add a script component to the button, with the following code:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine.Advertisements;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Button))]
public class UnityAdsButton : MonoBehaviour
{
	Button m_Button;
	
	public string placementId = "rewardedVideo";

	void Start ()
	{	
		m_Button = GetComponent<Button>();
		if (m_Button) m_Button.onClick.AddListener(ShowAd);
	}

	void Update ()
	{
		if (m_Button) m_Button.interactable = Advertisement.IsReady(placementId);
	}

	void ShowAd ()
	{
		var options = new ShowOptions();
		options.resultCallback = HandleShowResult;

		Advertisement.Show(placementId, options);
	}

	void HandleShowResult (ShowResult result)
	{
		if(result == ShowResult.Finished) {
			Debug.Log("Video completed - Offer a reward to the player");

		}else if(result == ShowResult.Skipped) {
			Debug.LogWarning("Video was skipped - Do NOT reward the player");

		}else if(result == ShowResult.Failed) {
			Debug.LogError("Video failed to show");
		}
	}
}
```
